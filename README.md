# Newsletter Bot
This project aims to implement a bot using UiPath Studio which its scraping data in order to create a newsletter regarding a specific subject.
It works as follows:
  1. A Chrome Window is opened
  2. Data regarding the specific subject (in this case, Manchester United news) is scraped from the internet
  3. A .hmtl page is configured and saved locally/sent via G-mail to a specific user.
